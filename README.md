## Description

This repo demonstrates a scalable ML pipeline that:

- **Ingests** raw visitor data into GCS  
- **Processes** and transforms it via Cloud Dataflow  
- **Stores** structured tables in BigQuery  
- **Enriches** with Vertex AI for sentiment analysis & lead scoring  
- **Orchestrates** via Airflow for both batch and live workloads  
- **Delivers** actionable insights to sales & marketing teams

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Clone & Install**  
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:your-org/e2e-leads-machine-learning-pipeline.git
   cd e2e-leads-machine-learning-pipeline
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure**  
   Create a `.env` file or export these variables:
   ```bash
   GCP_PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>
   GCP_REGION=<your-region>
   BQ_DATASET=<your_dataset>
   LEAD_MODEL_ENDPOINT=<vertex-ai-endpoint-id>
   SENTIMENT_MODEL_ENDPOINT=<vertex-ai-endpoint-id>
   ```

3. **Trigger Pipelines**  
   ```bash
   airflow dags trigger load_gcs_to_lake
   airflow dags trigger leads_records
   ```

## Flow Explained in Steps

1. Ingest raw data into GCS
2. Load into BigQuery Lake via `load_gcs_to_lake` DAG
3. Clean & Transform with Cloud Dataflow
4. Store processed datasets in BigQuery
5. Enrich using Vertex AI:
   - Sentiment Analysis on text
   - Lead Quality Scoring on structured features
   - Persist predictions back to BigQuery
6. Orchestrate downstream tasks in `leads_records` DAG
7. Serve enriched leads from `BigQuery_Leads_Records`

## Sentiment vs Lead Quality Score

**Sentiment Analysis**  
- *Inputs:* Unstructured text (reviews, chat transcripts, emails)  
- *Outputs:* Polarity (positive/neutral/negative) + strength score  
- *Value:* Measure lead enthusiasm and concerns  

**Lead Quality Score**  
- *Inputs:* Structured features (demographics, behavior, CRM data)  
- *Outputs:* Conversion probability (0â€“1) or categorical label (hot/warm/cold)  
- *Value:* Prioritize leads for sales outreach  

Combining both signals yields a holistic lead profile for smarter routing and higher ROI.

## Practical Usage

1. **Batch Scoring**  
   Schedule Vertex AI Batch Prediction for bulk updates.
2. **Real-time Scoring**  
   Deploy Vertex AI Endpoints for live lead scoring in your apps.
3. **Result Integration**  
   Use Airflow SQL operators to merge predictions into core tables.
4. **Rule-based Prioritization**  
   Define business rules (e.g., high-score/negative sentiment â†’ human review).
5. **Monitoring & Retraining**  
   Enable Model Monitoring and automate retraining on drift detection.
